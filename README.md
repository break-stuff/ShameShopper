# Welcome to the Shame Shopper Challenge!!!

## Your Objective:

Become familiar with the core functionality of the Vue.js framework. This project has two directories: `start` and `finish`. The `start` directory is a clean slate for you to code your challenge in. The `finish` directory is an example of the finished product. Keep in mind that your project ***does not*** have to look like that at the end. There are many ways to skin a cat in Vue.

Avoid looking at it as much as possible and instead look at the [Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org) for explanations and examples on how to use the framework. The documentation is ***excellent***!
